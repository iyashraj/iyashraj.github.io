          I'm a full-stack developer passionate about building scalable and user-friendly applications. I enjoy combining thoughtful frontend design with robust backend systems to deliver smooth experiences.
        </p>
        <p className="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Some highlights of my work include developing a SaaS-based LMS-LOS platform at <strong>Arthmate</strong> using Next.js, Supabase, AWS, and Redis, and building real-time messaging platforms at <strong>Brimming Grace</strong> with React, Django, and PostgreSQL. Iâ€™ve also integrated payment gateways and led a small frontend team to production-ready results.

        <p className="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
          My toolkit includes React, Next.js, Redux, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, Django, PostgreSQL, and additional experience with Supabase, AWS, Docker, and AI/ML tools such as LangChain, FAISS, and OpenAI APIs. Iâ€™m comfortable collaborating with cross-functional teams and quickly adapting to new technologies.

          Beyond development, I enjoy <span className="underline decoration-wavy text-orange-500">coding</span>, <span className="underline decoration-wavy text-orange-500">music</span>, and <span className="underline decoration-wavy text-orange-500">memes</span> ðŸŽµðŸ’»ðŸ˜‚ â€” a mix that keeps my creativity flowing.
